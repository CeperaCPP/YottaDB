The Makefile enclosed will build gtm from source.  The only prerequisite is
GNU make and Linux x86.   GNU make 3.77 and Redhat 6.1 were used to do the
test builds for this distribution.

To build gtm for linux just type "make".

By default the make will build three buildtypes: dbg (debug), bta (beta),
and pro (production).   Passing a subset of dbg, bta, or pro in "buildtypes"
from the environment or the command line will build that subset. For example:

	make buildtypes=pro

will build just a production release.

Once the required builds have been done the object distribution can be
tar'ed by doing:

	make package

Again, buildtypes can be used to package just a subset. For example:

	make buildtypes=pro package
